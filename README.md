Kata for using Ractive

## RactiveKata Tasks

We're going to explore how we would use Ractive to dynamically handle form editing.

### Step 1

Fork and clone this repo

### Step 2

Create an array of people and add this to your data within Ractive.

```js
// Example
var people = [
    { name: "Name", age: 0, isMinor: false }
];
```

### Step 3

Use a Ractive `each` loop to display each person in your people array, along with an edit button

### Step 4

Use Bootstrap to display this table in a clean, responsive way.

### Step 5

Add an Edit function to your Ractive to enable editing of your array of people

### Step 6

Make a pull request

**Good luck!**
